ghdecoy
=======

ghdecoy is a tool to vandali^H improve the github contributions calendar. 
It is inspired by gitfiti [https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti] but
with a different use case in mind.

ghdecoy allows you to create a git repository containing commits crafted
in way so that when it is pushed to github the contribution calendar is
overlayed with a distinct pattern so as to obscure the actual activity
of the particular account.

What sets ghdecoy apart from similar tool, like the mentioned gitfiti, is
for now mostly the fact that it is primarily intended to be run
non-interactively so it can e.g. easily be used in a cron job.

In addition to that eventually it is supposed to take a more 'intelligent'
approach to crafting it's fake commits. 
The goal is for ghdecoy to be able to take into account and modify the
commits in the decoy repository so that a constant static 'noise' can be
displayed in the contributions calender regardless of the frequency of
invocation of the tool.
