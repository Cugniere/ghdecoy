ghdecoy
=======

ghdecoy is a tool to vandali^H optimize the github contributions calendar. 
It is inspired by gitfiti [https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti] but
with a different use case in mind.

ghdecoy allows you to create a git repository containing commits crafted
in way so that when it is pushed to github periods in the contribution
calendar containing no commits will be filled with a random pattern so your
account looks sufficiently active.
